                </header>
                <p>A lot has been said about creating design systemsand much of it focuses on establishing foundations for color, typography, grids, texture and the like. This type of thinking is certainly important, but I'm slightly less interested in these aspects of design because ultimately they are and will always be subjective. Atomic design is methodology for creating design systems. There are five distinct levels in atomic design: Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates, Pages.</p>

                        <p><b>Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter.</b>Applied to web interfaces, atoms are our HTML tags, such as a form label, an input or a button. Atoms can also include color palettes, fonts and animations. They're fairly abstract and often not terribly useful on their own. However, they're good as a reference in the context of a pattern library as you can see all your global styles laid out at a glance.</p>

Building up from molecules to organisms encourages creatingstandalone, portable, reusable components.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>At the template stage, we break our chemistry analogy to get into language that makes more sense to our clients and our final output. Templates consist mostly of groups of organisms stitched together to form pages. It's here where we start to see the design coming together and start seeing things like layout in action.</p>

                        <p><b>Templates are very concrete and provide context to all these relatively abstract molecules and organisms.</b> Templates are also where clients start seeing the final design in place. In my experience working with this methodology, templates begin their life as HTML wireframes, but over time increase fidelity to ultimately become the final deliverable. </p>

                        <p><b> Pages are specific instances of templates.</b>  Here, placeholder content is replaced with real representative content to give an accurate depiction of what a user will ultimately see. Pages are the highest level of fidelity and because they're the most tangible, it's typically where most people in the process spend most of their time and what most reviews revolve around.</p>

                        <h2>why atomic design</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Atomic design provides a clear methodology for crafting design systems. Atomic design gives us the ability to traverse from abstract to concrete. Because of this, we can create systems that promote consistency and scalability while simultaneously showing things in their final context. And by assembling rather than deconstructing, we're crafting a system right out of the gate instead of cherry picking patterns after the fact</p>

            <header>
                <h2>testing the system</h2>
            </header>
            <p>The page stage is essential as it's where we test the effectiveness of the design system. Viewing everything in context allows us to loop back to modify our molecules, organisms, and templates to better address the real context of the design.</p>
            <p>Pages are also the place to test variations in templates. For example, you might want to articulate what a headline containing 40 characters looks like, but also demonstrate what 340 characters looks like. What does it look like when a user has one item in their shopping cart versus 10 items with a discount code applied? Again, these specific instances influence how we loop back through and construct our system.</p>

                    <p>Atomic design can require considerably more thought and planning, but it's often worth the extra effort. So what are the main benefits of it?</p>
